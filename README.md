Weather forecast app that gets the user location and provides currently, daily and hourly forecast. 

In case it is raining it warns the user of that. 

It uses JSON to get data from api.forecast.io.

This app is inspired in a Tree House tutorial that helps to implement a weather app. 

Soon, I will upload screen shots of the app.

To run the app use a real device or an emulator that simulates location such as genymotion.
