# J Weather Forecast App
==============================================================================

J Weather is an app that provides weather forecast according to the user's location. It is possible to check the current, daily and hourly forecast, as well as current chance of rain, wind speed, moon phase, Sunrise and Sunset time. This app is inspired in a Tree House tutorial that helps to implement a weather app.
